# App
Overview

This project implements a transparent and fair Request for Proposal (RFP) system on the Stacks blockchain using Clarity. The contract demonstrates how procurement can be done with commit–reveal bidding, on-chain verification, and immutable winner selection.

✨ Why It Wins

🔒 Fairness – Vendors commit first, then reveal later to prevent tampering.

📜 Transparency – All proposals and results are permanently stored on-chain.

🏆 Simplicity – Less than 100 lines of code, easy to audit, deploy, and extend.

🚀 Alignment with Web3 Vision – Clear, open, and verifiable procurement process that fits the goals of Google Clarity Web3.

🔄 Workflow

Owner creates RFP with deadlines.

Vendors commit hashed proposals.

Vendors reveal actual proposals after commit phase ends.

Owner finalizes and records the winner on-chain.
